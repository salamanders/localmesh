## Debugging `disco` Animation Playback

### Current State

We are trying to debug why the `disco` animation is not playing inside the WebView.

- The `integration_test.sh` script reports success for the `disco` animation because it finds the `LOCALMESH_SCRIPT_SUCCESS:disco` message in the logcat.
- However, the user has observed that no video is playing on the device.

### Paths Tried

1.  **Initial test run:** The full `integration_test.sh` script was run, but it failed on the `motion` animation.
2.  **Isolated tests:** The script was modified to run only specific animations. `snakes` passed, but the user reported that `disco` did not visually work, even though the test passed.
3.  **Video file validation:** The `disco_01.mp4` video file was pushed to the device and confirmed to be playable using the native "Files" app.
4.  **JavaScript error handling:** An `error` event listener was added to the video elements in `disco/index.html`, but no "Video Error" messages were observed in the logcat.
5.  **Ktor server logic:** An attempt was made to fix the asset serving logic in `LocalHttpServer.kt` to better support partial content, but the implementation was flawed and removed critical directory handling logic.

### Known Facts

- The `disco_01.mp4` video file is not corrupt and can be played by the device's native video player.
- The `play()` promise for the video element in the `disco` animation's JavaScript is resolving, which is why the `LOCALMESH_SCRIPT_SUCCESS:disco` message is being logged.
- The logcat shows `net::ERR_FAILED` errors from the WebView for the video files.
- The logcat also shows "Broken pipe" and "Connection reset by peer" errors from the Ktor server when trying to serve the video files.

### Hypothesis

The primary hypothesis is that the Ktor server is not correctly handling HTTP range requests (i.e., `PartialContent`) for assets served from the `assets` folder. This is crucial for video streaming in a web browser. The `net::ERR_FAILED`, "Broken pipe", and "Connection reset by peer" errors are all symptoms of the WebView's video player giving up on the stream because it cannot get the partial content it needs to buffer and play the video. The issue is not with the video files themselves, but with how they are being served by the Ktor server and consumed by the WebView.

## `AssetManager` Refactoring and Unit Test Debugging

The refactoring of the file handling to a centralized `AssetManager` was a success, but it was a long and difficult process. Here is a summary of what I learned and how I solved the problem.

### The Problem

The initial refactoring broke the unit tests in `LocalHttpServerTest`. The tests that served static files started failing with `AssertionError` because the response body was empty. My initial hypothesis was that there was a conflict between the `staticFiles` handler and one of the other Ktor plugins.

### The Debugging Process

My debugging process was initially flawed. I was making assumptions without evidence and trying to fix too many things at once. This led me down a number of wrong paths, including:

*   **Incorrectly disabling plugins:** I tried to disable the Ktor plugins one by one, but I made syntax errors and didn't properly isolate the problem.
*   **Logging difficulties:** I struggled to get logs from the unit tests, which made it difficult to diagnose the problem.
*   **Test setup thrashing:** I went back and forth between initializing the server in the `setUp` method and in the individual test methods.

### The Breakthrough

The breakthrough came when I was finally able to get logs from the tests. The logs showed that the `staticFiles` handler was using the wrong directory to serve files. The root cause was that the `LocalHttpServer` was being created in the `setUp` method with a generic mock context, before the test-specific mock context was configured.

### The Solution

The solution was to move the `LocalHttpServer` initialization and startup from the `setUp` method into each individual test method that required a specific mock context. This ensured that the server was always created with the correct `filesDir` for that test.

### Key Takeaways

*   **Take small, evidence-backed steps.** Don't make assumptions without evidence.
*   **Use logging to your advantage.** Find a way to get logs from your tests, even if it's difficult.
*   **Be careful with test setup.** Make sure that your tests are properly isolated and that you are not sharing state between them.

## General Development Journal

### Goal

To prove that a `WebView` in the app can use permission-gated APIs (like motion sensors) without a user click, by having the native code grant permissions and trigger the necessary JavaScript.

### Strategy

The strategy is to add a text input box to the main `index.html` page. When text is entered, the JavaScript will use it as a `sourceNodeId` query parameter on its requests. This will simulate a request from a peer, causing the app's server to process the request locally instead of broadcasting it. This allows for end-to-end testing of the local display logic directly through the UI.

### Progress on Automated Testing

* **Objective:** Achieve a fully automated, end-to-end test script that can be executed by the `gemini-cli`.
* **Initial Failures:** Early attempts to start the `BridgeService` directly from `adb` were unsuccessful due to Android security policies (service not exported, background start restrictions).
* **Successful Refactoring:** To solve this, a testing hook was added to `MainActivity`. It now checks for a boolean `auto_start` Intent extra, which allows it to bypass the UI and trigger the service start sequence automatically. This brings the app to the foreground correctly while maintaining automation. **STILL NEEDS TO BE VERIFIED**
* **Process Improvement:** A series of incorrect assumptions during the testing phase led to the creation of a "Core Mandate: The 'Prove-It' Workflow," which has been added to this document to enforce a stricter, evidence-based development cycle.
* **Current Status:** We have identified what we think is the correct `adb` command (`adb shell am start -ez auto_start true`) to trigger the testing hook. The next step is to execute this command and verify that it successfully launches the app and service without manual interaction, finally clearing the path for the full end-to-end test.
