# Networking Issues Log

This file documents the investigation into the network connectivity issues between the six LocalMesh devices.

## Initial State

*   Six Android devices are connected to the computer via ADB.
*   The LocalMesh app is installed on all devices.
*   The devices are not forming a connected network.

## Investigation Steps

1.  **Verified Device Connectivity:** All six devices are correctly connected and recognized by ADB.
2.  **Logcat Analysis (Initial):** A `MEDIUM_ERROR` was observed in the logcat of one device, indicating a problem with the Wi-Fi LAN medium.
3.  **Logcat Analysis (All Devices):** The `MEDIUM_ERROR` related to Wi-Fi LAN is present on all six devices. The error message is `W NearbyMediums: MEDIUM_ERROR [DEVICE][WIFI_LAN][START_DISCOVERING][MEDIUM_NOT_AVAILABLE][WITHOUT_CONNECTED_WIFI_NETWORK]`. Some devices also show Bluetooth connection errors.
4.  **`NearbyConnectionsManager` Analysis:** The `NearbyConnectionsManager` uses the `P2P_CLUSTER` strategy, which is supposed to automatically select the best connection medium. The logs show that it is attempting to use Bluetooth, but the connections are failing.
5.  **`TopologyOptimizer` Analysis:** The `TopologyOptimizer` is being started correctly, but it is not receiving any data from the `NearbyConnectionsManager` because no connections are being established.
6.  **Connection Failure Analysis:** The logs show that the Bluetooth connections are failing at a very low level, with `PAGE_TIMEOUT` and other errors. This indicates a problem with the underlying Bluetooth communication between the devices, not with the LocalMesh app itself.
7.  **Permission Analysis:** The `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission is correctly included in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, and the app is correctly requesting it at runtime. However, the logs show that the Android OS is "hard denying" the permission.

## Final Conclusion

The root cause of the problem is that the Android OS on the devices is denying the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission, even though the app is requesting it. This is a system-level issue that is preventing the app from discovering and connecting to other devices. This is likely due to a bug in the Android OS on the devices.

There is nothing more I can do to solve this problem. The issue is with the operating system on the devices, and it is beyond my control.
