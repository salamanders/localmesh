# P2P Test Results - 6 Devices

**Test Date:** 2025-10-23

## Objective

To observe the behavior of the `TopologyOptimizer` in a real-world scenario with 6 connected devices.

## Methodology

1.  All 6 devices were flashed with the latest debug build of the LocalMesh application.
2.  The application was started simultaneously on all devices using the `auto_start` intent extra.
3.  The devices were left to run for 2 minutes to allow the network to stabilize and the `TopologyOptimizer` to perform its functions.
4.  `logcat` data was collected from all devices and filtered for logs related to the `TopologyOptimizer`.

## Observations

The following key observations were made from the aggregated `logcat` data:

*   **Successful Initialization:** The `TopologyOptimizer.start()` log message was present for all 6 devices, confirming that the optimizer was successfully initialized across the entire test group.

*   **Active Gossip Protocol:** The `Gossiped peer list to X peers` message appeared frequently in the logs of all devices. This indicates that the gossip protocol was active and that devices were successfully exchanging their lists of known peers with their direct neighbors. The number of peers in the gossip messages varied, which is expected as the network topology changed.

*   **Periodic Network Analysis:** The log message `Analyzing network for rewiring opportunities` was found on multiple devices. This confirms that the `TopologyOptimizer` was periodically executing its primary analysis loop to check for potential improvements to the network graph.

*   **No Rewiring or Island-Merging Events:** During the 2-minute test window, none of the following log messages were observed on any of the devices:
    *   `PERFORMING REWIRING`
    *   `Found redundant connection`
    *   `Analyzing network for potential islands`
    *   `Initiating island discovery`

## Conclusion

The `TopologyOptimizer` appears to be functioning as expected in its core duties. It successfully starts, participates in the gossip protocol by exchanging peer information, and periodically analyzes the network for optimization opportunities.

The absence of rewiring or island-merging events is not a sign of failure. Rather, it suggests that during the 2-minute test period, the network formed a stable and efficient topology that did not meet the criteria for intervention. The `TARGET_CONNECTIONS` constant (set to 3) in the `TopologyOptimizer` likely resulted in a balanced graph early on, and no connections were deemed redundant or isolated.

The test successfully validates the fundamental operation of the gossip and analysis components of the `TopologyOptimizer` on a 6-node network.
